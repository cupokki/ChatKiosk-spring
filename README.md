# ChatKiosk - SpringBoot

---

Rebuilding ChatKiosk project with SpringBoot. 

ChatKiosk has poor implementations of functional  features. And it had not Agent concept.
So This time I'll try LangChain with Ollama. Adding LangChain and Local LLM model was a plan after end of ChatKiosk project.

## Using Stack

- SpringBoot
- webflux
- LangChain4j
- Ollama

## Using LLM Model
